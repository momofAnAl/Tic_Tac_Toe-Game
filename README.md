- Program the classic tic-tac-toe game’s logic using Python
- Create the game’s graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter tool kit
- Integrate the game’s logic and GUI into a fully functional computer game

## Learning Goal

Major things that I want to focus on learning in this project

- Python GUI Programming with Tkinter
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python3
- When to use List Comprehension in Python
- Dictionaries in Python and how to interate through a Dictionary

## Technology
- Python 3.11
- Tkinter

## Installation

- The game uses Tkinter to build its user interface.
- Install Tkinter and make suure a version of Tkinter greater than or equal to 8.6.
